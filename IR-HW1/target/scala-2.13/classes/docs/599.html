Epitope Inc said its board of
directors has authorized a three-for-one common stock split for
which shareholder approval is expected in the next two weeks.
    The company announced a two-for-one split last week, but
said the board reconvened and agreed to change it to a
three-for-one split.
    Epitope is involved in the production of monoclonal
antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic use in AIDS and other
immunological diseases.
